Armbian configuration files for ENYBOX EM90 TV box

I'm posting here what I did to run Armbian on a 4G LTE EM90 box. The image I'm using is 
armbian_5.37_S9xx_Debian_stretch_3.14.29_icewm_20171226.

Copying the files to you /etc directory and replacing dtb.img on your boot partition should make everything work !
